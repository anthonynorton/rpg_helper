#Brain Storm

Document structure base on [**Decument Your MVP for a Developer** by **Tony Karrer**](http://www.socalcto.com/2012/12/document-your-mvp-for-developer.html)


##Business Concept
No "business concept". This is not to make money.
##Customer Development Notes
<small>Add notes from discussions about the application here</small>

##Prioritized User Stories
<small>Define the customer problems and beginnings of the solution through user stories (see user stories, user story).  Prioritize these stories.
Examples:
http://www.westborosystems.com/2010/02/user-story-examples/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Examples</small>

- As a user I can **create** a character.<small style="color: red;">priority: 1</small>
- As a user I can **view** a character.<small style="color: red;">priority: 1</small>
- As a user I can **edit** all the properties of a charactersheet.
- As a user I use the app to **auto generate** a character using a **random character generator**.
- As a user I can **use** my character in **play mode**.
- As a user I can use the app in its various modes:
  - Edit Mode
  - Play Mode
  - Create Mode
- As a user I can save my character to a database
- As a user I can use anyone of the character's skills
- As a user I can 


##Product Feature List
<small>Create a prioritized high level product feature list (see Product Backlog).  Make sure you look at [32 Questions Developers Should Ask a Startup Founder](http://www.socalcto.com/2011/08/32-questions-developers-may-have-forgot.html) to spark possible additional features.  Make sure you keep focused on your key business drivers and prioritize the features aggressively based on those drivers.

##Functional Details
For the higher priority features, begin to capture additional level of detail of those features particularly focusing on the behavior of the application.  See User Story is Worthless - Behavior is What We Need although you don't need your behavior description to be as formal as what is presented.  Really this begins to be a Functional Specification.  Developers don't need everything to be fully documented.  Rather are just looking for more detailed description of the features/functions.
Examples (these are going to be more detailed than you need to get to at this point):
Sample Spec
Functional Specification Example
##Wireframes, Comps, Clickable Prototype
Create wireframes for a few key screens that sketch your concept using a tool like Balsamiq.  
Send across any graphic designs you currently have.  
If you happen to have a clickable prototype, that's great.  That's fairly uncommon.
##Other Documentation
Here are other things you might be told about and
 try to capture:
